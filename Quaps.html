      <b>Que the Music </b></p></a>
  <p>It was a dismal day in Quishi, windy, drizzly, and foul smelling.</p>

  <p>The field of Quaps <a href="https://youtu.be/7o7CGlITKLI" target="_blank"> <b>stinky flowers</b></a>
    had all just blossomed in unison as if instructed by a mean chef
  <p>with no nose, or one so small as to be invisible,
    or so nonfunctional as to be useless on a good day.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The low flying Kreps were unprepared for the body stunning malodor, </p>
  <p>viciously and suddenly released into the air and they fell like rain plops</p>
  <p> as soon as they passed through the stinky atmosphere, landing on the ground, </p>
  <p>momentarily stunned, but quickly self revived as if swimming in smelling salts. </p>
  <p>They stood up as quickly as they recovered and pinched their noses to seal out the smell.</p>
  <p>Crying and screaming from pinching so hard, </p>
  <p>alternating blowing their noses...honKKKKK,,,honKKKKK, honKKKK...</p>
  <p>and looking frantically which direction was the shortest route out of the Quap patch. </p>
  <p>Their eyes squinting in tears as if sprayed by a minced onion perfume, </p>
  <p>they tried to coordinate with each other which way to go. </p>
  <p>This was very difficult to do as the honKKKKings got louder and louder, </p>
  <p>as more Kreps helplessly fell from the sky. </p>

  <p>As the shifting winds corralled the stench always over the Kreps,</p>
  <p>there was no good way out of this predicament.</p>
  <p>They had to rely on the assistance and ingenuity of those remaining</p>
  <p>but slower still floating and flapping Kreps that had not yet been affected by this fetor.</p>
  <p>Oh to have no nose....it would have been better....but such was not the case....</p>
  <p>for every living Krep had at least one nose, and always less than 2.</p>

  <p>It would have been a complete disaster if not for the littlest Krep, </p>
  <img src="baby Krep6.jpg" Little Baby Kreb width=100" height="200"/>
  <p>who had not yet been afflicted by the Quap's air borne attack. </p>
  <p>Too little to keep up with the flitter, but also aware of the impending fate </p>
  <p>that would also affect him/her if he/she did not change course and </p>
  <p>avoid the aerial calamity and chorus of honKKKKing Kreps, now in complete disarray.</p>

  <p>She/he was slow in speed, but quick in planning....</p>
  <p>She/he always was, and now was no different, </p>
  <p>as a plan started to form in her/his head.</p>



  <p>( Dear reader...Kreps when they are little are always a combination of girl and boy, </p>
  <p>which makes them much smarter as child Kreps than if they were either a girl or a boy. </p>
  <p>Later on in life they will decide which to be, </p>
  <p>depending on what is more fun or interesting for them, </p>
  <p>but until they are adults....they are MUCH, MUCH smarter </p>
  <p>than the adults with at least 2 points of view for every problem </p>
  <p>and at least 10 solutions, depending on the day, what they ate for lunch,</p>
  <p> if they were tired or there were fairies or dragons watching. </p>
  <p>(More of that later.)</p>
